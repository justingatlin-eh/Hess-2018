            Sustainability practices are a fundamental part of our company’s
            operations. We believe they create value for our shareholders and
            help position us to continuously improve business performance.
            Although the low oil price environment continued to be challenging
            for our industry in 2017, our commitment to excellence in
            operational, safety and environmental performance, stakeholder
            engagement and corporate citizenship has been unwavering. To that
            end, we have developed an environment, health, safety and social
            responsibility strategy with the input of our stakeholders that
            focuses our efforts on the areas most material to our business,
            including health and safety, climate change, community and
            stakeholder engagement, human rights and transparency.
          </p>
          <p>
            As part of our commitment, our Board of Directors and its committees
            are actively engaged in overseeing Hess’ sustainability practices
            and work alongside senior management to ensure that focus on these
            topics starts from the top. The Environment, Health and Safety (EHS)
            Subcommittee of the Board’s Audit Committee provides oversight and
            makes recommendations to the full Board of Directors with respect to
            Hess’ policies, positions and systems for environment, health,
            safety and social responsibility compliance and risk management.
            This ensures that climate change and environmental risks are
            discussed at the Board level and taken into account in strategic
            decisions. Furthermore, the Board’s Compensation Committee has tied
            executive compensation to advancing the environmental, health and
            safety goals of the company.

          <h4>Safety and Health</h4>
          <p>
            Our company’s top priority is the safety of our workforce and the
            communities in which we operate. We work closely with our employees
            and contractors to promote a strong safety culture, with the
            ultimate goal of everyone, everywhere, every day, home safe. As a
            result, we reduced both our 2017 workforce recordable incident rate
            and lost time incident rate by 38 percent compared with 2016, with
            improvements in both employee and contractor performance. While our
            overall safety performance was positive, our severe safety incident
            rate did not meet our internal target. After identifying an upward
            trend early in the year, we implemented immediate corrective actions
            that resulted in an 18 percent reduction in our severe safety
            incident rate from June to December. Severe safety incidents will
            continue to be a focus of our key improvement initiatives in 2018.
          </p>
          <p>
            We continually work to enhance our process safety management
            systems, which are an integral part of our business and play a
            critical role in mitigating risk. In 2017, we concluded a two-year
            assessment of our process safety management systems across the
            company, along with a review of the mechanical integrity of our
            onshore and offshore locations as part of our ongoing integrity
            management program. Recommendations and actions from both reviews
            will help inform improvement programs from 2018 onward.

          <h4>Environment and Climate Change</h4>
          <p>
            Climate change is a global challenge that requires government,
            business leaders and civil society to work together on
            cost-effective policy responses that recognize the vital role that
            safe, affordable and reliable energy plays in ensuring human
            welfare, economic growth and security. Our Board of Directors is
            regularly briefed on climate change by a subject matter expert to
            ensure that risks are considered in the development of company
            strategies and policies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on the International Energy Agency’s 2017 World Energy
            Outlook, oil and gas are essential to meet the world’s growing
            energy demand through 2040, even assuming a carbon-constrained
            future.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are committed to developing energy resources that the world needs
            in an environmentally responsible and sustainable manner. In June
            2017, the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, which
            was an outgrowth of the G20 Financial Stability Board, issued its
            final recommendations on how the financial sector should take
            account of climate-related issues. Our updated climate change
            strategy, which was implemented beginning in 2015, is closely
            aligned with these recommendations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our company has established 2020 reduction targets for greenhouse
            gases and flaring. Between 2008 and 2017, we reduced our equity
            greenhouse gas emissions by more than 6 million tonnes through
            improved operating practices and asset closures and divestitures. We
            will continue to take steps to monitor and measure our progress and
            develop energy resources responsibly.

          <h4>Social Responsibility</h4>
          <p>
            In 2017, we participated in multi-stakeholder initiatives designed
            to advance transparency, environmental protection, human rights and
            good governance, including continued support of the Voluntary
            Principles on Security and Human Rights. Hess continues to be
            involved in IPIECA, the global oil and gas industry organization for
            environmental and social issues, and the United Nations Global
            Compact and the Global Compact U.S. Network, which shares best
            practices in sustainable business conduct across the private sector.
          </p>
          <p>
            Stakeholder engagement processes are integrated into our enterprise
            risk workshops and asset business plans. In 2017, we initiated
            stakeholder engagement and grievance mechanism processes at two
            asset locations and carried out an integrated stakeholder mapping
            review at one additional location.

            11 PRODEGE (the Program for Educational Development of Equatorial
            Guinea) – a partnership between Hess and the Equatorial Guinean
            government that concluded at the end of 2017 – delivered programs
            and training focused on improving the quality of education, reaching
            more than 69 percent of the country’s student population. Since its
            inception in 2007, PRODEGE has benefited more than 135,000 students
            and 1,000 teachers who received program accreditation, with results
            that include:

            Succeed 2020, Hess’ $25 million North Dakota education and workforce
            initiative, concluded in 2017. The five-year program, aimed at
            improving the transition from secondary school to college and
            careers, had a positive effect on students, regional education
            authorities and related agencies across the state. Program outcomes
            include increasing the number of state scholarships by 8 percent and
            increasing high school completion rates by 1 percent.

            In 2017, Hess renewed its three-year commitment to the LEAP
            initiative (Learn, Engage, Advance, Persevere), which was introduced
            in 2014 at two middle schools in the Houston Independent School
            District, one of the largest school districts in Texas. LEAP 2.0
            represents a broader partnership with elementary, middle and high
            schools in the district with an aim to improve attendance and
            increase learning capabilities for students identified as at risk of
            dropping out. The initiative has offered more than 2,800 students a
            broad range of support, such as access to a home library reading
            program, in-school support services, college and career readiness
            training and expanded science, technology, engineering and
            mathematics program enhancements.

            In the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey and its devastating impact on
            the Houston community, our company took immediate steps to support
            recovery and rebuilding efforts, including a $1 million donation to
            the Hurricane Harvey Relief Fund. We implemented an employee
            assistance program to help those who were impacted by Hurricane
            Harvey and established a matching gift program for employees that
            raised more than $645,000 for three relief organizations. We also
            donated Hess Toy Trucks to schools near our Houston office and to
            holiday toy drives. For the 17th year, our Houston team took part in
            the MS 150, a two-day bike ride to support the National Multiple
            Sclerosis Society, and boosted Hess’ total donation to more than $1
            million.

          <h4>Environmental, Social and Governance Disclosure</h4>
          <p>
            Hess views transparency in reporting as a key part of being a
            trusted energy partner. Our company continued to be recognized in
            2017 for the quality of our environmental, social and governance
            disclosures, reinforcing our position as a top-quartile performer in
            our industry. We have been recognized as a leader in climate change
            transparency for the past nine years by the CDP, an international
            nonprofit group seeking to drive sustainable economies. We were
            named to Corporate Responsibility Magazine’s list of 100 Best
            Corporate Citizens for the tenth consecutive year and were one of
            only five oil and gas companies to make the list in 2017. Hess also
            was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index North America for
            the eighth consecutive year.
