            Our strategy is to grow our resource base in a capitaldisciplined
            manner, to move down the cost curve so we are resilient in a low oil
            price environment, and to be cash generative at a $50 per barrel
            Brent oil price post-2020. In 2017, we made substantial progress in
            executing this strategy and in positioning our company to deliver
            significant long-term value and superior financial returns to
            shareholders.

          <h4>High Graded, Focused Portfolio</h4>
          <p>
            We moved aggressively in 2017 to high grade and focus our portfolio
            by investing in our highest return assets – Guyana, which is one of
            the industry’s largest oil discoveries in a decade, and the Bakken,
            our largest operated asset where we have more than 500,000 net acres
            in the core of the play – and by divesting higher cost, mature
            assets.
          </p>
          <p>
            On a pro forma basis, our high graded portfolio is now expected to
            generate capital-efficient compound annual production growth of
            approximately 10 percent through 2023. The combination of investing
            in lower cost assets and divesting higher cost assets – along with a
            meaningful $150 million annual cost reduction program – is expected
            to drive our cash unit production costs down by approximately 30
            percent to less than $10 per barrel of oil equivalent by 2020. As a
            result, we expect to generate compound annual cash flow growth of
            approximately 20 percent through 2023 at a $50 per barrel Brent flat
            oil price.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our 2017 asset monetizations resulted in total proceeds of $3.4
            billion and the release of $1.3 billion of asset retirement
            obligations. In the fourth quarter, we announced and completed the
            sale of our mature, higher cost assets in Norway for proceeds of $2
            billion and in Equatorial Guinea for proceeds of $650 million. These
            sales followed the divestiture of our mature Permian enhanced oil
            recovery assets for total proceeds of $600 million and the
            successful IPO of Hess Midstream Partners that resulted in net
            proceeds to Hess Corporation of $175 million. In addition, we have
            commenced a sales process for our interests in Denmark.
          </p>
          <p>
            Proceeds from our asset sales will first be used to prefund our
            world-class investment opportunity in Guyana. In addition, in 2018
            we plan to increase from four rigs to six rigs in the Bakken, buy
            back up to $1.5 billion in stock and reduce debt by $500 million.
          </p>
          <p>
            Key to our strategy is our position in Guyana – an extraordinary oil
            investment opportunity that is uniquely advantaged by its scale,
            reservoir quality, cost, rapid cash paybacks and superior financial
            returns. The 6.6 million acre Stabroek Block in Guyana, where Hess
            has a 30 percent interest, represents one of the most attractive oil
            investment opportunities in the world today.
          </p>
          <p>
            In February 2018, Hess announced a seventh oil discovery at the
            Stabroek Block with the Pacora-1 well. This discovery followed a
            January 2018 announcement of positive results from the Ranger-1
            well, which encountered 230 feet of high quality, oil bearing
            carbonate reservoir. The Ranger discovery demonstrated that the
            petroleum system is working in a new geologic play in the Guyana
            Basin more than 60 miles northwest of the Liza development and
            reaffirmed the extraordinary exploration potential of the Stabroek
            Block. Excluding Ranger and Pacora, estimated gross discovered
            recoverable resources on the block were recently increased to more
            than 3.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent. In addition, we continue
            to see multi-billion barrels of additional exploration potential
            across the block.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Liza Phase 1 development offshore Guyana, sanctioned last June,
            will have the gross capacity to produce approximately 120,000
            barrels of oil per day, with first production expected by 2020. The
            second phase of the Liza development will have a gross production
            capacity of approximately 220,000 barrels of oil per day, with
            start-up expected by mid-2022.
          </p>
          <p>
            A third phase of development is planned to closely follow Liza Phase
            2 and is expected to bring gross production to more than 500,000
            barrels of oil per day.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our 2017 financial results continued to be impacted by lower crude
            oil and natural gas selling prices, and we posted an adjusted net
            loss of $1.4 billion. Cash flow from operations, before changes in
            working capital, was $1.7 billion, up from $842 million in the prior
            year. We replaced 351 percent of production with proved reserve
            additions of 397 million barrels of oil equivalent at an attractive
            finding and development cost of just over $5 per barrel of oil
            equivalent – an outstanding achievement. Proved reserves at year end
            stood at 1.15 billion barrels of oil equivalent, higher than 2016
            even with asset sales that reduced reserves by 239 million barrels
            of oil equivalent and production of 113 million barrels of oil
            equivalent during 2017, and our reserve life was 10.2 years.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the Bakken, net production averaged 105,000 barrels of oil
            equivalent per day in 2017 and is expected to reach 175,000 barrels
            of oil equivalent per day by 2021. Through the application of
            geosteering, optimized spacing, higher stage counts and proppant
            loading, we have increased well productivity by approximately 50
            percent over the last two years. These improvements, together with
            our low drilling and completion costs, have enabled us to generate
            returns that are competitive with the best shale plays in the United
            States.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2017, we achieved first gas at the North Malay Basin full field
            development in Malaysia and successfully advanced the Stampede
            development in the Gulf of Mexico, which achieved first oil in
            January 2018. Completion of these two developments establishes these
            assets as stable long-term cash generators for the company.
          </p>
          <p>
            On January 31, we announced a 2018 Exploration and Production
            (E&amp;P) capital and exploratory budget of $2.1 billion, flat with
            2017. Approximately two-thirds of our 2018 budget will be allocated
            for continuing exploration and development activities offshore
            Guyana and for the Bakken.
