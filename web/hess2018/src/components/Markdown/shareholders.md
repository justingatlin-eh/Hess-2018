# Letter to Shareholders

---

In 2017, we made significant progress in positioning our company to deliver significant value to shareholders. Our strategy is to grow our resource base in a capital disciplined manner, to move down the cost curve so we are resilient in a low oil price environment, and to be cash generative at a $50 per barrel Brent oil price post 2020.

### High Graded, Focused Portfolio

Consistent with our strategy, we moved aggressively in 2017 to high grade and focus our portfolio by investing in our highest return assets – Guyana, which is one of the industry’s largest oil discoveries in a decade, and the Bakken, where we have more than 500,000 net acres in the core of the play – and divesting higher cost, mature assets.

On a pro forma basis, our high graded portfolio is now expected to generate capital efficient compound annual production growth of approximately 10 percent per year through 2020. The combination of investing in lower cost assets and divesting higher cost assets – along with a meaningful $150 million annual cost reduction program – is expected to drive our cash unit production costs down by approximately 30 percent to less than $10 per barrel of oil equivalent by 2020. As a result, we expect to generate cash flow growth of more than 20 percent per year at a $50 per barrel Brent oil price and more than 30 percent per year at a $60 per barrel Brent oil price through 2020.

Our asset monetizations in 2017 resulted in total proceeds of $3.4 billion and the release of $1.3 billion of asset retirement obligations. During the year we announced and completed the sale of our mature, higher cost assets in Norway for total proceeds of $2 billion and Equatorial Guinea for total proceeds of $650 million. These sales followed the divestiture of our mature Permian enhanced oil recovery assets for total proceeds of $600 million and the successful IPO of Hess Midstream Partners that resulted in net proceeds of $175 million. In addition, we have commenced a sales process for our interests in Denmark, which we expect to complete in 2018.

Proceeds from our asset sales will first be used to prefund our world-class investment opportunity in Guyana. In addition, we plan to increase from four rigs to six rigs in the Bakken in the second half of 2018, buy back up to $500 million in stock and reduce debt by $500 million. [As we get further clarity on the capital requirements for future phases of development in Guyana as well as the outlook for oil prices, we plan to evaluate additional returns of capital to shareholders].

Key to our strategy is our position in Guyana – an extraordinary oil investment opportunity that is uniquely advantaged by its scale, reservoir quality, cost, rapid cash paybacks and superior financial returns. The Stabroek Block in Guyana, where Hess has a 30 percent interest, covers 6.6 million acres and contains some of the highest quality reservoirs in the world.

In January, we announced a sixth oil discovery on the Stabroek Block with the Ranger-1 well, which encountered 230 feet of high quality oil bearing carbonate reservoir and confirmed the presence of a working petroleum system more than 60 miles northwest of the Liza development area. In February, positive results from the Pacora-1 well confirmed a seventh oil discovery. Excluding Ranger and Pacora, gross discovered recoverable resources on the block are currently estimated at more than 3.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent. In addition, we continue to see multi billion barrels of additional exploration potential across the block.

The Liza Phase 1 development, sanctioned last June, will produce up to 120,000 barrels of oil per day with first production expected in March 2020. The second phase of Liza development will have a gross production capacity of approximately 220 thousand barrels of oil per day, with start up expected by mid-2022. The giant Payara field is planned as the third development, closely following Liza Phase 2 – bringing expected gross production from the first three phases of development to more than 500,000 barrels of oil per day.

With $7 per barrel unit development costs for Liza Phase 1 and cash payback in approximately three years at a $50 per barrel Brent oil price, our oil investment opportunity in Guyana is one of the most attractive in the world today.

Our 2017 financial results continued to be impacted by lower crude oil and natural gas selling prices, and we posted an adjusted net loss of $1.4 billion. Cash flow from operations, before changes in working capital, was $1.7 billion, up from $842 million in the prior year. We replaced 351 percent of production – with proved reserve additions of 397 million barrels of oil equivalent – at an attractive finding and development cost of just over $5 per barrel of oil equivalent. Proved reserves at year end stood at 1.15 billion barrels of oil equivalent – higher than 2016 even with asset sales – and our reserve life was 10.2 years.

In the Bakken, net production averaged 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2017 and is expected to reach 175,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2021. Through the application of geosteering, optimized spacing, higher stage counts and proppant loading, we have increased well productivity by approximately 50 percent over the last two years. These improvements, together with our low drilling and completion costs, have enabled us to generate returns that are competitive with any shale play in the United States.

On January 31, we announced a 2018 Exploration and Production (E&P) capital and exploratory budget of $2.1 billion,

flat with 2017. Approximately two thirds of our 2018 budget will be allocated for continuing exploration and development activities offshore Guyana and for the Bakken.

### Safety and Social Responsibility

Our company is committed to helping meet the world’s growing energy needs in a safe, environmentally responsible, socially sensitive and profitable way, which is why sustainability practices are a fundamental part of our business strategy and operations. We are proud to have been recognized once again in 2017 by a number of third-party organizations for the quality of our environmental, social and governance performance and disclosure.

Sustainable performance begins with comprehensive approach to safety. In 2017, we reduced our workforce recordable incident rate with improvements in both employee and contractor performance; however, our safety severe incident rate rose from 2016 due to an increase in dropped object incidents. By taking immediate corrective actions, our safety severe incident rate stabilized in the second half of 2017.
