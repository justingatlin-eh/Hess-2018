The Stabroek Block in Guyana, where Hess has a 30 percent\r\n            interest, covers 6.6 million acres and contains some of the highest\r\n            quality reservoirs in the world.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            In January, we announced a sixth oil discovery on the Stabroek Block\r\n            with the Ranger-1 well, which encountered 230 feet of high quality\r\n            oil bearing carbonate reservoir and confirmed the presence of a\r\n            working petroleum system more than 60 miles northwest of the Liza\r\n            development area. In February, positive results from the Pacora-1\r\n            well confirmed a seventh oil discovery. Excluding Ranger and Pacora,\r\n            gross discovered recoverable resources on the block are currently\r\n            estimated at more than 3.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent. In\r\n            addition, we continue to see multi billion barrels of additional\r\n            exploration potential across the block.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            The Liza Phase 1 development, sanctioned last June, will produce up\r\n            to 120,000 barrels of oil per day with first production expected in\r\n            March 2020. The second phase of Liza development will have a gross\r\n            production capacity of approximately 220 thousand barrels of oil per\r\n            day, with start up expected by mid-2022. The giant Payara field is\r\n            planned as the third development, closely following Liza Phase 2 –\r\n            bringing expected gross production from the first three phases of\r\n            development to more than 500,000 barrels of oil per day.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            With $7 per barrel unit development costs for Liza Phase 1 and cash\r\n            payback in approximately three years at a $50 per barrel Brent oil\r\n            price, our oil investment opportunity in Guyana is one of the most\r\n            attractive in the world today.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Our 2017 financial results continued to be impacted by lower crude\r\n            oil and natural gas selling prices, and we posted an adjusted net\r\n            loss of $1.4 billion. Cash flow from operations, before changes in\r\n            working capital, was $1.7 billion, up from $842 million in the prior\r\n            year. We replaced 351 percent of production – with proved reserve\r\n            additions of 397 million barrels of oil equivalent – at an\r\n            attractive finding and development cost of just over $5 per barrel\r\n            of oil equivalent. Proved reserves at year end stood at 1.15 billion\r\n            barrels of oil equivalent – higher than 2016 even with asset sales –\r\n            and our reserve life was 10.2 years.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            In the Bakken, net production averaged 105,000 barrels of oil\r\n            equivalent per day in 2017 and is expected to reach 175,000 barrels\r\n            of oil equivalent per day by 2021. Through the application of\r\n            geosteering, optimized spacing, higher stage counts and proppant\r\n            loading, we have increased well productivity by approximately 50\r\n            percent over the last two years. These improvements, together with\r\n            our low drilling and completion costs, have enabled us to generate\r\n            returns that are competitive with any shale play in the United\r\n            States.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            On January 31, we announced a 2018 Exploration and Production\r\n            (E&amp;P) capital and exploratory budget of $2.1 billion,\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            flat with 2017. Approximately two thirds of our 2018 budget will be\r\n            allocated for continuing exploration and development activities\r\n            offshore Guyana and for the Bakken.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </section>\r\n        <section>\r\n          <h4>Safety and Social Responsibility</h4>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Our company is committed to helping meet the world’s growing energy\r\n            needs in a safe, environmentally responsible, socially sensitive and\r\n            profitable way, which is why sustainability practices are a\r\n            fundamental part of our business strategy and operations. We are\r\n            proud to have been recognized once again in 2017 by a number of\r\n            third-party organizations for the quality of our environmental,\r\n            social and governance performance and disclosure.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Sustainable performance begins with comprehensive approach to\r\n            safety. In 2017, we reduced our workforce recordable incident rate\r\n            with improvements in both employee and contractor performance;\r\n            however, our safety severe incident rate rose from 2016 due to an\r\n            increase in dropped object incidents. By taking immediate corrective\r\n            actions, our safety severe incident rate stabilized in the second\r\n            half of 2017.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </section>\r\n        <section className=\"signatures\">\r\n          <div className=\"QuigSig\">\r\n            <div className=\"img\">\r\n              <img src={QuigleySig} />\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className=\"name\">James H.
