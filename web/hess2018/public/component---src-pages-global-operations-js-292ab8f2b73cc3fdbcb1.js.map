The decline in production year over year\r\n            was primarily the result of asset sales associated with the\r\n            strategic reshaping of the company’s portfolio, unplanned downtime\r\n            resulting from a fire at the Shell-operated Enchilada platform in\r\n            the Gulf of Mexico and natural field declines.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            In the Bakken, Hess’ operated rig count averaged 3.5 in 2017,\r\n            slightly higher than the average rig count of 3 in 2016. While the\r\n            company brought 68 new wells on production in 2017 compared with 100\r\n            wells in 2016, net production from the Bakken was flat year on year,\r\n            at 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Based on positive production results from our 60-stage,\r\n            140,000-pound proppant per stage completion design, we expect to\r\n            achieve an average 10-15 percent uplift in estimated ultimate\r\n            recovery and 180-day cumulative initial production rates per well,\r\n            compared with our previous 50-stage and 70,000-pound proppant per\r\n            stage completion design. As a result, we have increased our estimate\r\n            of net ultimate recovery from our Bakken acreage to 2.0 billion\r\n            barrels of oil equivalent from our previous estimate of 1.7 billion\r\n            barrels of oil equivalent.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            In the Utica shale play in eastern Ohio, where the company\r\n            participates in a 50 percent joint venture with CONSOL Energy, net\r\n            production averaged 19,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in\r\n            2017, compared to 29,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016,\r\n            reflecting natural field declines, as Hess did not bring any new\r\n            wells online in 2017. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, net\r\n            production averaged 54,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in\r\n            2017, compared with 61,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in\r\n            2016. This decrease is primarily the result of unplanned downtime\r\n            resulting from a fire at the Shell-operated Enchilada platform and\r\n            natural field declines, partially offset by a 7,000 barrels of oil\r\n            equivalent per day increase from the Tubular Bells Field (57 percent\r\n            working interest, operator). At the Carigali Hess-operated\r\n            Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area (50 percent working\r\n            interest) net production averaged 223 million cubic feet of gas\r\n            equivalent per day in 2017, compared with 206 million cubic feet of\r\n            gas equivalent per day in 2016. In the Danish North Sea, net\r\n            production from the South Arne Field (62 percent working interest,\r\n            operator) averaged 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2017,\r\n            compared with 13,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016,\r\n            reflecting natural field declines. In the fourth quarter of 2017,\r\n            the company commenced a sales process for our interests in Denmark,\r\n            which is expected to be completed in 2018.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </section>\r\n        <section className=\"img two\">\r\n          <img src={OilRig} />\r\n          <span>Production Operations, North Dakota</span>\r\n        </section>\r\n        <section>\r\n          <h4>Developments</h4>\r\n          <p>\r\n            At the North Malay Basin full field development project in the Gulf\r\n            of Thailand (50 percent working interest, operator), Hess completed\r\n            installation of the central processing platform and achieved first\r\n            gas in July 2017 safely, on time and under budget. The completion of\r\n            the full field development resulted in net production averaging 66\r\n            million cubic feet equivalent per day in 2017, compared with 28\r\n            million cubic feet equivalent per day in 2016.

In 2017, the company successfully installed the tension\r\n            leg platform and topsides on location, completed the development’s\r\n            first three production wells and completed all subsea work.
