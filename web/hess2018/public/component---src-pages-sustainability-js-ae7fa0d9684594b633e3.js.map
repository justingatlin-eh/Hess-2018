In addition,\r\n            we concluded a review of mechanical integrity at our onshore and\r\n            offshore locations as part of our ongoing integrity management\r\n            program. These assessments involved a detailed review of equipment\r\n            that is intended to avoid or mitigate a loss of primary containment.\r\n            Recommendations and actions from the process safety management\r\n            systems assessment and the mechanical integrity review will help\r\n            inform improvement programs from 2018 onward. Also in 2017, we met\r\n            our goal for creating and implementing performance standards and\r\n            maintenance and test plans for all integrity-critical equipment. In\r\n            2017, we achieved a 32 percent year-over-year reduction in process\r\n            safety events, as defined by the International Association of Oil\r\n            and Gas Producers, which is a testament to the ongoing enhancements\r\n            to our systems.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Our occupational health and wellness program includes industrial\r\n            hygiene, risk assessment and planning, workplace exposure control,\r\n            fitness for work assessment and medical emergency management. Hess\r\n            Environment, Health and Safety and Human Resources teams work\r\n            together to provide preventive medical services, international\r\n            travel vaccinations and flu shots to employees and family members.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Climate change is a global challenge that requires government,\r\n            business leaders and civil society to work together on\r\n            cost-effective policy responses that recognize the vital role that\r\n            safe, affordable and reliable energy plays in ensuring human\r\n            welfare, economic growth and security. The Environment, Health and\r\n            Safety Subcommittee of the company’s Audit Committee provides\r\n            oversight and makes recommendations to the full Board of Directors\r\n            with respect to Hess’ policies, positions and systems for\r\n            environment, health, safety and social responsibility, compliance\r\n            and risk management. This ensures that climate change and\r\n            environmental risks are discussed at the Board level and taken into\r\n            account in strategic decisions.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Based on the International Energy Agency’s IEA 2017 World Energy\r\n            Outlook, oil and gas are essential to meet the world’s growing\r\n            energy demand through 2040, even assuming a carbon-constrained\r\n            future. In June 2017, the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial\r\n            Disclosures, which was an outgrowth of the G20 Financial Stability\r\n            Board, issued its final recommendations on how the financial sector\r\n            should take account of climate-related issues. Our updated climate\r\n            change strategy, which was implemented beginning in 2015, is closely\r\n            aligned with these recommendations.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Our company has established 2020 reduction targets for greenhouse\r\n            gases and flaring. Between 2008 and 2017, we have reduced our equity\r\n            greenhouse gas emissions by more than 6 million tonnes through\r\n            improved operating practices and asset closures and divestitures. We\r\n            will continue to take steps to monitor, measure and develop energy\r\n            resources that the world needs in an environmentally responsible and\r\n            sustainable manner.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <div className=\"page-head-img img two\">\r\n            <img src={Riders} />\r\n            <span>\r\n              Team Hess Riders in MS 150 to Support the Multiple Sclerosis\r\n              Society\r\n            </span>\r\n          </div>\r\n          <p>\r\n            In 2017, we participated in multi-stakeholder initiatives designed\r\n            to advance transparency, environmental protection, human rights and\r\n            good governance, including continued support of the Voluntary\r\n            Principles on Security and Human Rights.

The five-year\r\n            program, aimed at improving the transition from secondary school to\r\n            college and careers, had a positive effect on students, regional\r\n            education authorities (REAs) and related agencies across the state.\r\n            Program outcomes include increasing the number of state scholarships\r\n            by 8 percent and increasing high school completion rates by one\r\n            percent.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            In 2017, Hess renewed its three-year commitment of the LEAP\r\n            initiative (Learn, Engage, Advance, Persevere) that was introduced\r\n            in 2014 at two middle schools in the Houston Independent School\r\n            District, one of the largest school districts in Texas. LEAP 2.0\r\n            represents a broader partnership with elementary and high schools in\r\n            the district with an aim to improve attendance and increase learning\r\n            capabilities for students identified as at risk of dropping out. The\r\n            initiative has offered more than 2,800 students a broad range of\r\n            support such as access to a home library reading program, in-school\r\n            support services, college and career readiness training and expanded\r\n            science, technology, engineering and mathematics program\r\n            enhancements.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            In the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey and its devastating impact on\r\n            the Houston community, our company took immediate steps to support\r\n            recovery and rebuilding efforts including a $1 million donation to\r\n            the Hurricane Harvey Relief Fund. We established a matching gift\r\n            program for employees who wanted to make a personal donation that\r\n            our company would match, which raised $491,000 for three relief\r\n            organizations, and donated Hess Toy Trucks to schools near our\r\n            Houston office and to holiday toy drives. For the 17th consecutive\r\n            year, our Houston team took part in the MS150, a two-day bike ride\r\n            to support the Multiple Sclerosis Society, and boosted Hess’ total\r\n            donation to more than $1 million.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            We view transparency in reporting as a key part of being a trusted\r\n            energy partner. Our company continued to be recognized in 2017 for\r\n            the quality of our environment, social and governance disclosures,\r\n            reinforcing our position as a top-quartile performer in our\r\n            industry.
