We believe they create value for our shareholders and help position us to continuously improve business performance. Although the low oil price environment continued to be challenging for our industry in 2017, our commitment to excellence in operational, safety and environmental performance, stakeholder engagement and corporate citizenship has been unwavering.</p>\n<p>Our company’s top priority is the safety of our workforce and the communities in which we operate. We work closely with our employees and contractors to promote a strong safety culture, with the ultimate goal of everyone, everywhere, every day, home safe. As a result, we reduced our 2017 workforce recordable incident rate by 38 percent compared with 2016, with improvements in both employee and contractor performance. We also reduced our workforce lost time incident rate 38 percent year-over-year. In 2017, we continued to ensure our safety goals are aligned with contractor companies through implementation of our Contractor Management Standard. While our overall safety performance was positive, our safety severe incident rate increased by 45 percent compared to 2016. After identifying this upward trend early in the year, we implemented immediate corrective actions that resulted in an 18 percent reduction our safety severe incident rate from June to December. Safety severe incidents will continue to be a focus of our key improvement initiatives in 2018.</p>\n<p>We continually work to enhance our process safety management systems, which are an integral part of our business and play a critical role in mitigating risk. In 2017 we concluded a two-year assessment of our process safety management systems. The assessment, which was conducted by an independent third party, was designed to identify improvement opportunities directly relevant to each asset as well as systemic opportunities across the company. In addition, we concluded a review of mechanical integrity at our onshore and offshore locations as part of our ongoing integrity management program. These assessments involved a detailed review of equipment that is intended to avoid or mitigate a loss of primary containment. Recommendations and actions from the process safety management systems assessment and the mechanical integrity review will help inform improvement programs from 2018 onward. Also in 2017, we met our goal for creating and implementing performance standards and maintenance and test plans for all integrity-critical equipment. In 2017, we achieved a 32 percent year-over-year reduction in process safety events, as defined by the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers, which is a testament to the ongoing enhancements to our systems.</p>\n<p>Our occupational health and wellness program includes industrial hygiene, risk assessment and planning, workplace exposure control, fitness for work assessment and medical emergency management. Hess Environment, Health and Safety and Human Resources teams work together to provide preventive medical services, international travel vaccinations and flu shots to employees and family members.</p>\n<p>Climate change is a global challenge that requires government, business leaders and civil society to work together on cost-effective policy responses that recognize the vital role that safe, affordable and reliable energy plays in ensuring human welfare, economic growth and security. The Environment, Health and Safety Subcommittee of the company’s Audit Committee provides oversight and makes recommendations to the full Board of Directors with respect to Hess’ policies, positions and systems for environment, health, safety and social responsibility, compliance and risk management. This ensures that climate change and environmental risks are discussed at the Board level and taken into account in strategic decisions.</p>\n<p>Based on the International Energy Agency’s IEA 2017 World Energy Outlook, oil and gas are essential to meet the world’s growing energy demand through 2040, even assuming a carbon-constrained future. In June 2017, the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, which was an outgrowth of the G20 Financial Stability Board, issued its final recommendations on how the financial sector should take account of climate-related issues. Our updated climate change strategy, which was implemented beginning in 2015, is closely aligned with these recommendations.</p>\n<p>Our company has established 2020 reduction targets for greenhouse gases and flaring. Between 2008 and 2017, we have reduced our equity greenhouse gas emissions by more than 6 million tonnes through improved operating practices and asset closures and divestitures. We will continue to take steps to monitor, measure and develop energy resources that the world needs in an environmentally responsible and sustainable manner.</p>\n<p>In 2017, we participated in multi-stakeholder initiatives designed to advance transparency, environmental protection, human rights and good governance, including continued support of the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights. Hess continues to be involved in IPIECA, the global oil and gas industry organization for environmental and social issues, and the United Nations Global Compact and the Global Compact U.S. Network, which shares best practices in sustainable business conduct across the private sector.</p>\n<p>Stakeholder engagement processes are integrated into our enterprise risk workshops and asset business plans. In 2017 we initiated stakeholder engagement and grievance mechanism processes at two asset locations and carried out an integrated stakeholder mapping review with one additional location.</p>\n<p>PRODEGE (the Program for Educational Development of Equatorial Guinea) continued to deliver programs and training to over 69 percent of the student population in 2017. Launched in 2007, the first phase of the program focused on improving the quality of education primary education in country; the second phase later expanded this work to include pre-school education as well. Since its inception, PRODEGE has benefitted more than 135,000 students and 1,000 teachers who received program accreditation, with results that include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Establishing the first Education Management Information System to strengthen institutional capacity, technical knowledge and improve data collection.</li>\n<li>Defining and developing a nationwide program for approximately 7,500 teachers in active learning methodology.</li>\n<li>Achieving a 34 percent decrease in students repeating first grade, an 8 percent increase in females attending and completing primary school, and 14 percent increase in ready-age students enrolling in primary school.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On November 28, Hess announced the completion of the sale of our interests in Equatorial Guinea, which concluded our funding of PRODEGE.</p>\n<p>Succeed 2020, Hess Corporation’s $25 million North Dakota education and workforce initiative, also concluded in 2017. The five-year program, aimed at improving the transition from secondary school to college and careers, had a positive effect on students, regional education authorities (REAs) and related agencies across the state. Program outcomes include increasing the number of state scholarships by 8 percent and increasing high school completion rates by one percent.</p>\n<p>In 2017, Hess renewed its three-year commitment of the LEAP initiative (Learn, Engage, Advance, Persevere) that was introduced in 2014 at two middle schools in the Houston Independent School District, one of the largest school districts in Texas. LEAP 2.0 represents a broader partnership with elementary and high schools in the district with an aim to improve attendance and increase learning capabilities for students identified as at risk of dropping out. The initiative has offered more than 2,800 students a broad range of support such as access to a home library reading program, in-school support services, college and career readiness training and expanded science, technology, engineering and mathematics program enhancements.</p>\n<p>In the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey and its devastating impact on the Houston community, our company took immediate steps to support recovery and rebuilding efforts including a $1 million donation to the Hurricane Harvey Relief Fund. We established a matching gift program for employees who wanted to make a personal donation that our company would match, which raised $491,000 for three relief organizations, and donated Hess Toy Trucks to schools near our Houston office and to holiday toy drives. For the 17th consecutive year, our Houston team took part in the MS150, a two-day bike ride to support the Multiple Sclerosis Society, and boosted Hess’ total donation to more than $1 million.</p>\n<p>We view transparency in reporting as a key part of being a trusted energy partner. Our company continued to be recognized in 2017 for the quality of our environment, social and governance disclosures, reinforcing our position as a top-quartile performer in our industry. In particular, we have been recognized as a leader in climate change transparency for the past nine years by the CDP, an international non-profit group seeking to drive sustainable economies. We were named to Corporate Responsibility Magazine’ list of 100 Best Corporate Citizens for the tenth consecutive year, and were one of only five oil and gas companies to make the list in 2017. Hess also was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index North America for the eighth consecutive year.</p>\n<p>Additional detail on our environment, social and governance programs and progress, as well as performance data, can be found in our annual sustainability report.</p>"}}]}},pathContext:{}}}});
